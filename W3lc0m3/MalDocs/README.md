  Starting With Excel MalDoc
</h1>


The initial analysis began with making sure everything was safe in the lab: Check's Performed --> NAT Adapter Disabled and Inetsim OFF.

I started a python3 http server to transfer the sample over to my remnux box, after the sample was transfered succesfully i took a note that the

file extension was .xlsm which means that the document had developer macros enabled. The Next Part of the Analysis was to unzip it and run 

oledump against the sample. This Was the output.

The `M` means that, the VBA/Module1 is the one that has a certain script enabled within itself. After running another oledump command that let me 

look for strings, there was few intersting result's. As we can see below there is a specific domain and a cmd command that opens powershell and execute's

`.\run.ps1`
