      Analyst,

      This specimen came from a poor decision and a link that should not have been clicked on. 
      No surprises there. We need to figure out the extent of what this thing can do. It looks a little advanced.
      Perform a full analysis and send us the report when done. We need to go in depth on this one to determine what 
      it is doing, so break out your decompiler and debugger and get to work!
