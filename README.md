This Repository is dedicated towards Malware Analysis and Software Reverse Engineering. I had an idea to start such project 
on 𝗦𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝟭𝟱, 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟮. As the time will pass, I'm planning on adding `Report's` on my findings on all the different
kinds of Malware. The Report Structure I came up with is having ....
  
  * Written Report && Findings
  * Yara Rule
  * Snort Signature 

Most of the sample's that I will be working with are planned to come from trusted sources like --> [vx-underground](https://www.vx-underground.org/), [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/), [TheZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) ᴀɴᴅ [PMAT-LABS](https://github.com/HuskyHacks/PMAT-labs).

will help with guidance.

Everyone is welcome to add their own sample's and finding's, just make sure the `REPORT` is similar to my other ones.
